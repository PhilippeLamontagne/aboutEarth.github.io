## About the Earth

Environmental data is freely available from a number of sources. 

Sources of open data on the web typically conform to a published standard and may provide an API to assist in gathering the data for your purposes.  The use of the API often requires that the user register a website (such as the ones listed below) to add traceability and help prevent denial-of-service attacks.

Some example client application hosted on this site
   * [SpotOn](https://StephenMottyNRC.github.io/SpotOn)
   
       Retrieves current weather data from the [Canadian Government](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/geospatial-web-services.html) and monitors the accuracy of various weather models for each weather station.
       This site is currently under construction and is provided AS IS to serve as a reference for similiar endeavours by open data enthusiasts.
