## About the Earth

Environmental data is freely available from a number of sources. 

Sources of open data on the web typically conform to a published standard and may provide an API to assist in gathering the data for your purposes.  The use of the API often requires that the user register a website (such as the ones listed below) to add traceability and help prevent denial-of-service attacks.

The [Meteorological Service of Canada provides an API](https://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet/features/api?f=html) for access to information about the weather and climate.  The API supports three types of services:

   1. Web Mapping Service (WMS) mainly provides graphical maps with option to query values for individual pixels.
   2. Web Coverage Service (WCS) renders grids, point clouds, and general meshes of space/time varying phenomena.
   3. Web Feature Services (WFS) provides parsable data in GeoJSON and other formats

Some example client applications hosted on this site
   * [SpotOn](https://StephenMottyNRC.github.io/SpotOn)
   
       Retrieves current weather data from the [Canadian Government](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/geospatial-web-services.html) and monitors the accuracy of various weather models for each weather station.
       This site is currently under construction and is provided AS IS to serve as a reference for similiar endeavours by open data enthusiasts.
