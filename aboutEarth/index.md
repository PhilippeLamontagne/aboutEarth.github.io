## About the Earth

Environmental data is freely available from a number of sources. 

Sources of open data on the web typically conform to a published standard and may provide an API to assist in gathering the data for your purposes.  The use of the API often requires that the user register a website (such as the ones listed below) to add traceability and help prevent denial-of-service attacks.

The [Meteorological Service of Canada provides an API](https://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet/features/api?f=html) for access to information about the weather and climate.  The API supports three types of services:

   1. Web Mapping Service (WMS) mainly provides graphical maps with option to query values for individual pixels.
   2. Web Coverage Service (WCS) renders grids, point clouds, and general meshes of space/time varying phenomena.
   3. Web Feature Services (WFS) provides parsable data in GeoJSON and other formats

Providing local weather data is an easy way to make an important contribution to the future of the Earht and its inhabitants.  There are a number of commercially available system for publishing your data on-line.  As the number of providers of environmental data grows, it becomes necessary to locate a "one-stop shop" that can deal with the inevitable range of formats and protocols.  [ERDDAP](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html) provides this one-stop shop.  See the list of client applications hosted on this site for an example of how to use an ERDDAP server to collect complete datasets for environmental studies.

Some example client applications hosted on this site
   * [ERDDAP](/ERDDAP)
   
       Displays a list of Canadian climate stations and receives weather news about from various sources for any selected station.

   * [SpotOn](/SpotOn)
   
       Retrieves current weather data from the [Canadian Government](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/geospatial-web-services.html) and monitors the accuracy of various weather models for each weather station.

These sites are currently under construction and are provided AS IS to serve as a reference for similiar endeavours by open data enthusiasts.
